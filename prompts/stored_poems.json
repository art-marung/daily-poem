    "poem": "In the soft weave of morning light,  \na shadow dances on the wall,  \nas a small bird flits from branch to branch,  \nits call a sweet note in the hush of dawn.  \n\nA gentle breeze carries whispers,  \nrustling leaves and stirring petals,  \neach moment a quiet wave,  \nlifting the heart with simple grace.  \n\nA stranger offers a smile,  \na hand holds another just so,  \nkindness blooms in the spaces between,  \nwhere we soften for one another.  \n\nIn this tender exchange, we find  \nthe day’s breath lingers,  \nquietly wrapping us in warmth,  \nsmall joys echoing across the hours.",
