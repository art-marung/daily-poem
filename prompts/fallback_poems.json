    "poem": "The morning knocks.\nI did not dream.\n\nI could have passed\nthrough the deepest silence,\nthe darkest room,\nwithout knowing.\n\nInstead, I wake.\n\nThe feeling arrives first,\nthen the light,\nthe breeze,\na quiet scent in the air.\n\nThe day opens without asking.\nTime waits, wide and patient.\n\nThe sun will set.\nSomething in me rises.\n\nI bow to the quiet,\nand stay there a moment,\nlistening inward,\nwhere being awake\nfeels enough."
  },
  {
    "poem": "It is early in the morning.\nThe sun holds low at the horizon.\nThe sky is smog and air.\n\nEveryone seems late for somewhere.\nPedestrians carry their bags.\nCars move quickly.\nTime feels small.\n\nAlong the roadside,\nsomeone is still asleep,\nuntouched by the rush.\n\nThe light keeps spreading.\nThe world does not pause,\nyet nothing asks to be explained.\n\nFor now,\nthis is enough."
  },
  {
    "poem": "Sitting quietly in the room alone.\nI forgot to play music.\n\nThe soft sound of the television\ncomes from the other room.\nEyes rest on the computer screen.\nThe mind moves through small ideas.\nKeys tap.\nThen stop.\n\nA glance at the blank wall,\nas if something might appear.\nThe window waits.\nCurtains lift and settle\nwith a thin current of air.\n\nA cup cools on the floor\nbeside a small table.\nA dumbbell nearby.\nKeys and small gadgets rest where they are.\n\nOutside, children are playing.\nThe moment asks for little,\nonly that I stay,\nand let it pass."
  },
  {
    "poem": "The day does not ask you to be more.\nIt opens a small space and waits.\n\nLight moves across the floor\nas if practicing patience.\n\nSomewhere, a cup warms your hands.\nA breath arrives without effort.\n\nNothing remarkable happens —\nand still, this is enough."
  },
  {
    "poem": "There are moments that pass quietly,\nunnoticed, like a door left open.\n\nAir moves through the room.\nTime loosens its grip.\n\nYou are here, and the world\ndoes not rush you away.\n\nSomething gentle remains."
  },
  {
    "poem": "Not every good thing announces itself.\nSome arrive softly, already present.\n\nThe way stillness holds the edges of sound.\nThe way morning waits\nbefore becoming busy.\n\nYou do not have to reach for this.\nIt is already with you."
  },
  {
    "poem": "A cup rests on the table.\nIt has nothing left to offer.\n\nHands settle in a lap,\nlearning the shape of stillness.\n\nLight touches the wall,\nthen drifts away.\nA sound fades,\nleaving room behind it.\n\nAir moves through the room,\nunnoticed,\ndoing what it has always done.\n\nNothing asks to be named.\nNothing needs to stay."
  },
  {
    "poem": "A chair waits by the window.\nLight gathers on its edge.\n\nDust moves slowly\nas if remembering the air.\nThe room holds its breath\nand then lets it go.\n\nNothing asks to be finished.\nNothing needs a name.\nThe day is already here,\nsettling in."
  },
  {
    "poem": "Water fills the glass\nwithout sound.\nYour fingers linger\na moment longer than needed.\n\nSomewhere, a clock forgets itself.\nThe room stays still.\n\nWhat matters arrives gently,\nwithout announcement,\nand stays."
  },
  {
    "poem": "The hallway is quiet.\nFootsteps have passed\nand left no trace.\n\nA door rests half open.\nAir moves through,\nbringing nothing new,\ntaking nothing away.\n\nTime loosens.\nThe moment holds."
  },
  {
    "poem": "Light touches the table\nand moves on.\nA shadow follows,\nthen fades.\n\nOutside, something shifts.\nInside, nothing needs to.\n\nYou remain,\nnot waiting,\nnot rushing,\njust here."
  },
  {
    "poem": "The room settles\nafter the door closes.\n\nA chair remembers your weight.\nThe air adjusts.\n\nNothing follows.\nNothing waits.\n\nFor a moment,\nthe day holds still,\nas if listening\nfor what comes next."
  },
  {
    "poem": "Evening arrives\nwithout ceremony.\n\nLight thins along the wall.\nSounds loosen their grip.\n\nWhat was unfinished\nrests where it is.\nWhat mattered\ndoes not ask again.\n\nThe day exhales."
  },
  {
    "poem": "A page stays open\nlonger than needed.\n\nWords pause.\nThe hand does too.\n\nSome thoughts pass through.\nOthers sit quietly,\ncontent to remain unnamed.\n\nThe moment does not hurry you.\nIt stays."
  },
  {
    "poem": "Before sleep,\nthe body softens its guard.\n\nBreath finds an easier rhythm.\nThe dark feels familiar.\n\nNothing needs to be carried forward.\nNothing needs to be held back.\n\nRest arrives\nwithout instruction."
  },
  {
    "poem": "The light feels farther away\nthan it did earlier.\n\nSounds arrive\na little softened.\nMovement takes its time.\n\nNothing asks to be completed.\nNothing insists.\n\nThe room remains,\npatient,\nletting the moment\nbe slower than planned."
  },
  {
    "poem": "The day has already been busy.\nIt does not need more from you.\n\nAir moves through the space.\nA surface cools beneath your hand.\n\nThoughts drift,\nthen rest.\nThe pause stretches\nwithout explanation.\n\nFor now,\nbeing here\nis enough."
  },
  {
    "poem": "Something in the afternoon\nloosens its grip.\n\nEdges blur slightly.\nTime widens.\n\nWhat mattered earlier\ncan wait.\nWhat arrives now\ncomes quietly.\n\nThe moment settles,\nasking only\nto be noticed,\nand left as it is."
